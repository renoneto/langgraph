    "# Reflexion Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an upgrade of the Reflection Agent, we will use Search API and Function Calling + Prompt Techniques to create a more advanced agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture of the Reflexion Agent:\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/reflexion_agent.jpg\" alt=\"Reflection Agent\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Start with a Respoder that contains the Response, Critique and Search Queries to improve the response.\n",
    "2. Then we use a tool to execute the Search Queries (Tavily)\n",
    "3. The Revisor Node will take the initial response and the search responses and then improve the response + critique it as well + new search queries + citations\n",
    "4. This goes back to the Tool to search again and get more information.\n",
    "5. The process continues until the response is satisfactory or a certain number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "6. Finally, the agent will output the final response with citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is for the agent to create an article with quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Files\n",
    "`schemas.py`: This file contains the schemas for the Reflexion Agent, including the `Reflection`, `AnswerQuestion` and `ReviseAnswer` classes.\n",
    "`tool_executor.py`: This file contains the code for the tool executor that will execute the search queries and return the results.\n",
    "- Concepts:\n",
    "  - Using `ToolNode` which is a class that allows the agent to execute tools (like search APIs) and get results. We define only one tool node for the Search API.\n",
    "  - To run the searches in batch we need to create a list of messages containing the `tool_calls` with the name of the tool and arguments. Moreover, the \"id\" is what LangGraph uses to connect the tool node with the responder and revisor nodes.\n",
    "  - We then parse the responses and construct a list of `ToolMessage` objects that contain the results of the search queries.\n",
    "- Search API: An API that allows the agent to perform searches based on the queries generated by the responder and revisor nodes.\n",
    "`chains.py`: This file contains the chain definitions for the Reflexion Agent, including the responder and revisor chains.\n",
    "`main.py`: This is where we construct the graph and run it"
